Sorry I will ***NOT*** opensource it, at least in one year. And It's ***quite easy*** to rewrite it if you want.

Latest release: 2020.7.26 (freestyle,standard,renju,and several engines for special use), See release page

Now there are gomoku(freestyle,standard,renju,caro), reversi, connect6, breakthrough, hex, "four in a row", Chinese checkers, and many board games few people play.

Now it's the strongest program on this games as I know: 
all kinds of gomoku(compared with Embryo)
connect6(compared with gzero)
hex(compared with gzero and)
Chinese checkers(compared with Shangxin Tiaoqi)
